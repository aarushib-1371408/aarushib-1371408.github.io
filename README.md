# **Pioneers of Computing**

## **_Ada Lovelace_**

![Ada Lovelace image](images/photos/people/lovelace/picture.jpg)

Date of Birth: December 10, 1815  
Date of Death: November 27, 1852  
Age at Death : 36 years  
Area of Research: Lovelace’s study was focused on math and science, which she later expanded to programming (as we know it now).

### Key Facts about her personal life
- She got married at the age of nineteen to William King, and gave birth to two sons and a daughter. In the course of this marriage, he became an Earl, and hence Lovelace became the Countess of Lovelace.
- Lovelace died at the age of thirty six due to uterine cancer.

### Key Professional Contributions
- Lovelace wrote a program, which calculated the seventh Bernoulli number, for the Analytical Engine.
- She wrote the first computer program and described how the computer would work – the Notes section of an academic paper, which she published.

### Interesting quote from Lovelace's Obituary
This quote demonstrates how passionate she was about her work and studies.
> “You see that matrimony has by no means lessened my taste for these pursuits, nor my determination to carry them on”.

### Reflective Paragraph
Lovelace thought about the notion of artificial intelligence and the responsibility of the person programing the machine. If given a chance, I would like to ask her if she thinks that individuals in our contemporary society have taken that responsibility seriously? Numerous scholars argue that in lieu of achieving something better programmers often forget their responsibilities :worried: and the consequences of this are bared by our society as a whole. I think with her having worked in a predominantly male- led industry, her opinion would be very valuable and interesting.

## **_Alan Turing_**

Date of Birth: June 23, 1912  
Date of Death: June 7, 1954  
Age at Death : 41 years  
Area of Research: Turing’s research and study predominantly focused on computing machines.

### Key Facts about her personal life
- He proposed marriage in 1941 to Joan Clarke, a Bletchley Park cryptanalyst. He later explained his sexuality to her and ended the engagement.
- Turing shared a physical relationship with Arnold Murray, due to which he was charged with gross indecency by the court. As a result he was ordered to undergo chemical castration.  

### Key Professional Contributions
- Turing played a key role in decoding the codes of the Enigma machine – thus propelling the Allied victory.
- He conceived the Universal Turing Machine – which provided key insight in establishing the general-computer.

### Interesting quote from Lovelace's Obituary
This quote demonstrates how important Turing's skills were in decoding the German code.  
> “The critical factor was Turing’s brilliant mechanization of subtle logical deductions,” the biographer Hodges wrote.

### Reflective Paragraph
Turing has the idea of a single machine – for all possible tasks :+1: . If I had a chance to ask him a question, I would ask whether he ever thought possible that this proposed machine would be able to aid differently abled individuals? I would also like to get further insight about his perspective on machines potentially replacing many of the jobs that humans currently do? He was a visionary who saw a future for computing machines, hence it would be really interesting to hear his opinion on the use of computing machines now. I am curious to know if he would be excited about the progress and support it, or whether he would believe that humans are irreplaceable and maneuver the progression of computing machines in a different direction.
